Aim:The aim of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights from Zomato's data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. By examining restaurant ratings, user reviews, and geographic patterns, the goal is to identify trends, understand consumer preferences, and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing restaurant offerings and optimizing the user experience on the Zomato platform

Description:Using Zomato data, I employed Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to derive valuable insights. Zomato, a popular online food delivery app, provided rich datasets that were analyzed to uncover trends and patterns in restaurant ratings, user reviews, and geographic preferences. NumPy and Pandas facilitated data manipulation and cleaning, while Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create visualizations that illustrated key findings, such as distribution of restaurant ratings, popular cuisines, and regional dining preferences.

Dependencies: numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn
